========================================
🚀 GITHUB SETUP - STEP BY STEP 🚀
========================================

## YOUR PROJECT ISN'T ON GITHUB YET

Here's how to get it there so Railway can deploy it:

---

## STEP 1: CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY

1. Go to **github.com** (sign in or sign up)
2. Click the **"+"** icon (top right) → **"New repository"**
3. Repository name: `ai-decision-engine-api` (or any name)
4. Description: "AI Decision Engine API - RESTful API for AI-driven decision making"
5. Choose **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
6. **DON'T** check "Initialize with README"
7. Click **"Create repository"**

---

## STEP 2: PUSH YOUR CODE

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\aigen\Desktop\ai weed"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - AI Decision Engine API"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace:**
- `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username
- `YOUR-REPO-NAME` with your repository name

---

## STEP 3: BACK TO RAILWAY

1. Go back to Railway
2. The "Loading..." should finish
3. Type your repository name: `username/repo-name`
4. Or click the dropdown to see your repos
5. Select your repository
6. Railway will deploy!

---

## QUICK COMMANDS (Copy-Paste Ready)

After creating GitHub repo, run these in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\aigen\Desktop\ai weed"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Git not installed?
- Download from: git-scm.com
- Install it
- Restart terminal

### Authentication error?
- GitHub now requires personal access token
- Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
- Create token with "repo" permissions
- Use token as password when pushing

### Repository not found?
- Check repository name spelling
- Verify it's created on GitHub
- Make sure it's public (or you have access)

---

## AFTER PUSHING:

1. ✅ Code is on GitHub
2. ✅ Go back to Railway
3. ✅ Type your repo name
4. ✅ Railway will deploy!
