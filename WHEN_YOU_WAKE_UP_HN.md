## 💬 Common Comments to Prepare For

### If someone asks about pricing:
```
The pricing is hybrid - $9/month base gives you 10,000 requests, then $1 per 1,000 overage. This way you get predictable base costs but only pay for what you use beyond that.

The free tier (100 requests/month) is perfect for testing. No credit card required.
```

### If someone asks about tech:
```
Built with FastAPI, which I chose for:
- Fast performance
- Automatic OpenAPI docs
- Easy async support
- Great developer experience

Stripe handles payments, Railway for hosting. The usage tracking is custom-built to show real-time costs.
```

### If someone asks "why build this?":
```
I was frustrated with API pricing that had hidden costs. Built this to solve my own problem - needed transparent, predictable pricing for an AI decision system. Figured others might want it too.
```

### If someone is critical:
- Be humble and open to feedback
- Don't be defensive
- Thank them for the feedback
- Explain your reasoning if asked
