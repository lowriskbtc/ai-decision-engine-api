# HackerNews Posting Guide 🚀

## ✅ What is HackerNews?

**HackerNews (news.ycombinator.com)** is:
- A news/forum site for tech entrepreneurs and developers
- Run by Y Combinator (the startup accelerator)
- **NOT about hacking** - it's about tech news, startups, and interesting projects
- Very welcoming to "Show HN" posts (show off your projects!)

**It's safe!** Just a regular website like Reddit, but focused on tech/startups.
