# Building Reddit Credibility - Quick Guide 🎯

## ✅ Smart Strategy!
Being active before posting helps avoid spam filters and builds trust. Great plan!

## 📋 Why Your Post Was Removed (AutoModerator Message)

**The exact reason:**
- ❌ Account is too new (needs to be at least 1 month old)
- ❌ Not enough comments (needs "several comments" before posting)
- ❌ Jumped straight to posting without participating

**This is fixable!** You just need to:
1. Wait for account to age (1 month minimum)
2. Comment on other posts (build activity)
3. Participate in the community first

**Good news:** Your plan to be active is exactly what you need to do!

## 🎯 Goal: Build Trust First

**Why this works:**

- Builds account karma
- Reduces spam filter risk
- Makes your future posts more credible

**Requirements (from AutoModerator):**
- ✅ Account must be at least 1 month old
- ✅ Need "several comments" before posting
- ✅ Must participate in community first

**How long:**
- **Account age:** Wait until account is 1 month old (or use older account)
- **Activity:** Comment daily for 1-2 weeks
- **Comments:** Aim for 20-50+ comments before posting again
- **Best:** 1 month old account + 2 weeks of daily commenting

---

## 📅 Timeline

### Week 1-2 (Now):
- **Focus:** Build credibility and wait for account to age
- **Action:** Comment on 5-10 posts daily across relevant subreddits
- **Time:** 15-30 minutes/day
- **Goal:** 20-50+ comments total

### Week 3-4:
- **Continue:** Daily commenting
- **Also:** Respond to comments on your r/SideProject post
- **Time:** 15-30 minutes/day
- **Check:** Is your account 1 month old yet?

### After Account is 1 Month Old + 20+ Comments:
- **Ready to post:** Account should meet requirements
- **Post on:** r/fastapi (your post is ready!)
- **Then:** Continue engaging

**Note:** If your account is already 1 month old, you just need to build comment history (1-2 weeks of daily commenting should be enough)
