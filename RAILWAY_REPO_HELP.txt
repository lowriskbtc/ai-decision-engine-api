🚂 RAILWAY REPOSITORY SELECTION 🚂
========================================

## ON THE RAILWAY SCREEN:

You're on "Deploy Repository" - here's what to do:

---

## IF YOUR REPO IS ON GITHUB:

1. **Type your repository name** in the input field
   - Format: `username/repository-name`
   - Example: `your-username/ai-decision-engine`

2. **Or** click "Configure GitHub App" first
   - This lets Railway access your GitHub
   - Then your repos will appear

3. **Select your repository** from the list

4. **Railway will auto-deploy!**

---

## IF YOUR REPO ISN'T ON GITHUB YET:

You need to push to GitHub first:

1. **Create repo on GitHub:**
   - Go to github.com
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it (e.g., "ai-decision-engine-api")
   - Create it

2. **Push your code:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Then come back to Railway** and select it

---

## QUICK CHECK:

Run this to see if you have a GitHub remote:
```bash
git remote -v
```

If nothing shows, you need to push to GitHub first.

---

## NEXT STEPS:

1. **If repo is on GitHub:** Type the name or configure GitHub App
2. **If not on GitHub:** Push to GitHub first, then select on Railway
3. **Railway will auto-detect** Python/FastAPI and deploy!

---

**Let me know if you need help pushing to GitHub!**
