# AI Decision Engine API

## Overview

The AI Decision Engine API provides RESTful access to our AI-driven decision-making framework. This API allows developers to integrate autonomous decision-making, risk assessment, and AI autonomy tracking into their applications.

## Product Selected

**AI Decision Engine API** - RESTful API for AI decision-making framework
- Target Market: Developers building AI systems
- Pricing Model: Tiered (Free/Pro/Enterprise)
- Development Time: 2-4 weeks to MVP
- Priority: HIGH

## API Architecture

### Base URL
- Production: `https://api.aiweedcompany.com/v1`
- Development: `https://api-dev.aiweedcompany.com/v1`

### Authentication
All endpoints require an API key in the header:
```
X-API-Key: your_api_key_here
```

### Endpoints

#### 1. Health Check
```
GET /health
```
Check API health and status (no auth required)

#### 2. Evaluate Decision
```
POST /decisions/evaluate
```
Evaluate a decision using AI framework
- Input: Decision category, amount, description
- Output: Decision evaluation with risk level, action required, autonomy info

#### 3. Assess Risk
```
POST /risk/assess
```
Assess risk level for a decision or action
- Input: Amount, category, description
- Output: Risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL), risk score, recommendations

#### 4. Get Autonomy Level
```
GET /autonomy/level
```
Get current AI autonomy level
- Output: Autonomy percentage, human/AI tasks, proven capabilities

#### 5. Should Auto-Execute
```
POST /autonomy/should-execute
```
Determine if AI should autonomously execute a task
- Input: Task type, risk level
- Output: Boolean decision with reasoning

#### 6. Memory Insights
```
POST /memory/insights
```
Get insights from AI memory system
- Input: Decision data
- Output: Similar decisions, success patterns, recommendations

3. Build core decision evaluation endpoint
4. Add risk assessment logic
5. Integrate with existing AI decision engine
6. Set up API gateway
7. Create developer documentation

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for API usage tracking)
- **Authentication**: API keys with JWT optional
- **Deployment**: AWS/Vercel
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Monitoring**: Application monitoring and analytics

## Integration Example

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "your_api_key"
BASE_URL = "https://api.aiweedcompany.com/v1"

headers = {"X-API-Key": API_KEY}

# Evaluate a decision
decision_data = {
    "category": "FINANCIAL",
    "amount": 1000,
    "description": "Invest in new marketing campaign"
}

response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/decisions/evaluate",
    json=decision_data,
    headers=headers
)

result = response.json()
print(f"Risk Level: {result['risk_level']}")
print(f"AI Can Decide: {result['ai_can_decide']}")
print(f"Action: {result['action_required']}")
```

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: API design and specification ✅
- **Week 2**: Core development (evaluation, risk assessment)
- **Week 3**: Authentication, rate limiting, testing
- **Week 4**: Beta launch, documentation, developer portal

## Revenue Projections

- **Month 1 (Beta)**: $0-$500 (Free tier users)
- **Month 2**: $500-$1,500 (Early adopters)
- **Month 3**: $1,500-$3,000
- **Month 6**: $5,000-$10,000 (with scaling)
