I built an API for AI-powered decision-making with a focus on transparent pricing.

Most API pricing is confusing with hidden costs. I wanted something different:
- See your usage in real-time
- Track costs before billing
- Hybrid model: $9/mo base + pay-as-you-go overage
- Free tier: 100 requests/month

Built with FastAPI, includes 20+ endpoints for decision evaluation, risk assessment, and autonomy tracking.
