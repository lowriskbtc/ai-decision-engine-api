## 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Build Reddit Credibility (CURRENT FOCUS!)
**When:** Daily for 1-2 weeks (until account is 1 month old + 20-50+ comments)
**Time:** 15-30 minutes/day
**Why:** AutoModerator requires account to be 1 month old with "several comments" before posting

**Requirements (from AutoModerator):**
- ✅ Account must be at least 1 month old
- ✅ Need 20-50+ comments before posting
- ✅ Must participate in community first

**Action Plan:**
- Comment on 5-10 posts in r/fastapi daily (be helpful!)
- Comment on 3-5 posts in r/SideProject daily (support others!)
- Upvote quality content
- Respond to comments on your r/SideProject post
- **Don't mention your API yet** - just be helpful and genuine
- **Track progress:** Aim for 20-50+ comments total

**See:** 
- `BUILDING_REDDIT_CREDIBILITY.md` - Detailed guide
- `ACCOUNT_REQUIREMENTS.md` - AutoModerator requirements explained

### 2. Respond to Comments on r/SideProject
**When:** Daily, as comments come in
**Time:** 5-10 minutes
**Why:** Engagement drives more visibility and signups

- Go to your r/SideProject post
- Reply to EVERY comment
- Be helpful and engaging

### 2. Post on r/fastapi (RECOMMENDED NEXT!)
**When:** Tomorrow (wait 2-3 hours after your last post)
**File:** `REDDIT_POSTS.md` (r/fastapi post)
**Post Flair:** `Showcase` or `Project` (REQUIRED!)
**UTM Link:** `?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=launch`
**Expected:** 100-300 visitors, 10-25 signups
**Why:** Better fit than r/webdev - more targeted audience, less strict rules

### 3. Post on HackerNews (READY NOW!)
