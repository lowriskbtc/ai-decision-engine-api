## Title
```
Show HN: AI Decision Engine API – Transparent usage-based pricing
```

## Post Body
```
I built an API for AI-powered decision-making with a focus on transparent pricing.

Most API pricing is confusing with hidden costs and surprise bills. I wanted something different:

- See your usage in real-time
- Track costs before billing
- Hybrid model: $9/mo base + pay-as-you-go overage
- Free tier: 100 requests/month (no credit card)

Built with FastAPI, includes 20+ endpoints for decision evaluation, risk assessment, and autonomy tracking. Perfect for developers building autonomous systems, trading bots, or AI decision frameworks.

Tech stack: FastAPI (Python), Stripe for payments, Railway hosting. Full OpenAPI docs included.

Docs: https://web-production-62146.up.railway.app/docs

Would love feedback from the HN community!

**Body:**
```
I built a SaaS API with a transparent pricing model that shows costs in real-time.

Problem: Most APIs have confusing pricing with hidden costs.

Solution: Hybrid model with real-time usage tracking:
- $9/mo base subscription
- $1 per 1,000 requests overage

- Dashboard shows costs before billing

Technical details:
- FastAPI backend

- Real-time usage analytics

The API provides 20+ endpoints for AI decision-making, risk assessment, and autonomy tracking.

2. **Respond quickly** - Answer comments within 30 minutes
3. **Be technical** - HN audience appreciates depth
4. **Don't ask for upvotes** - Against rules, will get flagged
5. **Be honest** - Share what you learned, challenges faced

### What to Expect:
- **If it hits front page:** 1000-5000+ visitors, 50-200+ signups
- **If it doesn't:** 50-200 visitors, 5-15 signups
- **Comments:** Expect technical questions, pricing feedback

### Common Questions to Prepare For:
1. "Why not just use [existing service]?"
2. "How is this different from [competitor]?"
3. "What's your tech stack?"

## Follow-up Comments (If It Gets Traction)

### If someone asks about pricing:
```
The pricing is hybrid - $9/month base gives you 10,000 requests, then $1 per 1,000 overage. This way you get predictable base costs but only pay for what you use beyond that.

The free tier (100 requests/month) is perfect for testing. No credit card required.
```

### If someone asks about tech:
```
Built with FastAPI, which I chose for:
- Fast performance
- Automatic OpenAPI docs
- Easy async support
- Great developer experience

Stripe handles payments, Railway for hosting. The usage tracking is custom-built to show real-time costs.
```

### If someone asks "why build this?":
```
I was frustrated with API pricing that had hidden costs. Built this to solve my own problem - needed transparent, predictable pricing for an AI decision system. Figured others might want it too.
