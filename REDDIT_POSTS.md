## r/SideProject (BEST FOR FIRST POST)

**Title:**
```
Built an AI Decision Engine API - Free tier available, transparent pricing
```

**Body:**
```
Hey r/SideProject!

I just launched my first SaaS API and would love feedback from this community.

**What it does:**
I built an AI Decision Engine API that helps developers integrate AI-powered decision-making into their apps. It includes endpoints for:
- Decision evaluation with risk assessment
- Autonomy level tracking
- Strategic planning
- 20+ endpoints total

**Why I built it:**
I was frustrated with confusing API pricing models (hidden costs, surprise bills). So I built something with radical transparency - you see your usage and costs in real-time, before you're billed.

**Pricing:**
- **Free:** 100 requests/month (no credit card required)
- **Pro:** $9/month + $1 per 1,000 requests overage
- **Enterprise:** $49/month + $0.50 per 1,000 requests overage

**Tech Stack:**
- FastAPI (Python)
- Stripe for payments
- Railway for hosting
- Real-time usage tracking

**What I learned:**
- Building in public is scary but rewarding
- Developers really value transparency
- Free tier drives signups (obvious but worth noting)

**Try it free:** https://web-production-62146.up.railway.app
**API Docs:** https://web-production-62146.up.railway.app/docs

Would love feedback, especially from developers building AI/automation tools. What features would you want to see?

Thanks! 🚀

## r/startups (BUSINESS ANGLE)

**Title:**
```
Launched my first SaaS API - Lessons learned and free tier for feedback
```

**Body:**
```
Hey r/startups!

Just launched my first SaaS product and wanted to share the journey + get feedback.

**What I built:**
An AI Decision Engine API - a SaaS API that helps developers integrate AI-powered decision-making into their applications.

**The Journey:**
- Started 2 weeks ago with an idea
- Built MVP in FastAPI
- Integrated Stripe for payments
- Deployed to Railway
- Launched today!

**Lessons Learned:**
1. **Transparency matters** - Developers hate surprise bills. I built real-time usage tracking so users see costs before billing.
2. **Free tier works** - Offering 100 free requests/month (no credit card) drives signups.
3. **Pricing is hard** - Went with hybrid model: $9/mo base + usage-based overage. Still iterating.
4. **Documentation is critical** - Spent more time on docs than I expected, but it's worth it.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ API deployed and working
- ✅ Payment processing live
- ✅ Free tier available
- ⏳ First paying customer (goal: this week!)

**Pricing:**
- Free: 100 requests/month
- Pro: $9/month + overage
- Enterprise: $49/month + overage

**Try it:** https://web-production-62146.up.railway.app

Would love feedback from fellow founders:
- Is the pricing model clear?
- What would make you pay for this?
- Any red flags I should fix?

Thanks! 🚀
