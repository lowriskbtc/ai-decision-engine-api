========================================
🚀 PUSH CODE TO GITHUB - STEP BY STEP 🚀
========================================

## STEP 1: CREATE REPOSITORY ON GITHUB

On the GitHub page you're on:

✅ Repository name: `ai-decision-engine-api` (already filled - perfect!)
✅ Owner: `lowriskbtc` (your username)
✅ Visibility: **Public** (good!)

❌ **DON'T check** "Add README" (we have code already)
❌ **DON'T check** "Add .gitignore" (we have one)
❌ **DON'T check** "Add license" (skip for now)

**Click the green "Create repository" button**

---

## STEP 2: AFTER CREATING REPOSITORY

GitHub will show you a page with instructions.

**IGNORE those** - we'll use our commands instead.

---

## STEP 3: PUSH YOUR CODE

I'll help you run these commands one by one.

Ready? Let's start!
