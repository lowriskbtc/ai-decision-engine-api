🚀 Just launched my AI Decision Engine API!

A SaaS API that gives developers AI-powered decision-making capabilities with transparent, usage-based pricing.

Free tier available → https://web-production-62146.up.railway.app

Let me tell you what makes it different 🧵👇
```

### Tweet 2:
```
Most API pricing is confusing. Hidden costs. Surprise bills. Rate limits that appear out of nowhere.

I built this with radical transparency:
• See your usage in real-time
• Track costs before you're billed
• Know exactly what you'll pay
• No surprises. Ever.
```

### Tweet 3:
```
The pricing model is hybrid (best of both worlds):

FREE: 100 requests/month
PRO: $9/mo + $1 per 1K overage
ENTERPRISE: $49/mo + $0.50 per 1K overage

Your dashboard shows exactly where you are. No guessing.
